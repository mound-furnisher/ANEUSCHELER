Collaborative submission to Arch Out Loud's NUCLEAR competition completed with  architect Daniel Van Dyk in 2017. The submission proposes a series of  monumental stone rings and lead plugs to designate a dangerous and 
    sacred area around the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant's (WIPP) massive 
    underground nuclear disposal area. The New Mexican site's toxic contents would be protected from intervention through the formation of a religion with its main precepts being the sacredness of the ground underneath and the care thereof.
